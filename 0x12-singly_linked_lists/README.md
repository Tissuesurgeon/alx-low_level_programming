This project is on Singly linked lists.......





A singly linked list is a data structure in which a sequence of elements, called nodes, are connected by links, each node pointing to the next node in the sequence. Each node consists of two parts: the data part, which contains the element, and the next part, which contains a reference to the next node in the list.

The first node in the list is called the head of the list, and the last node is called the tail. If the tail points to null, it indicates the end of the list.

Singly linked lists are dynamic data structures, meaning that nodes can be added or removed from the list at any time. They are commonly used in computer science for various applications, including implementing stacks, queues, and hash tables.

The main advantage of singly linked lists is that they are efficient in terms of memory usage and can grow or shrink in size as needed. However, they are not as efficient as arrays for accessing elements in the middle of the list, as each element must be traversed in order from the head of the list.
